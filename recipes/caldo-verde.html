      <h3>Steps</h3>
        <hr>
        <ol>
          <li>Wash your potatoes and kale.</li>
          <li>Cut your russet potato in to small, uniform pieces. Cut your waxy potatoes in to uniform pieces. Cut or tear your kale.
             Dice your onion and mince your garlic. Cut the sausage in to bite size pieces. You want your potatoes, kale and sausage 
             cut to a size for a spoonful of soup. 
          </li>
          <li>In a large stock pot or dutch oven, bring your chicken stock to a boil. Add your russet potato and cook for 20-30 minutes
            until the potato starts to break down. These will break down during the rest of cooking and thicken the soup a bit. 
          </li>
          <li>While this is cooking, in a large skillet or saute pan on medium heat, add your cut up sausage and cook until it gets a bit of color.
            Remove sausage from the pan and set aside. Add your diced onion and cook until translucent. Add in your minced garlic and cook for 
            an additional minute. Add your ground chorizo to the pan. Break up the chorizo to your desired bite size and cook until cooked trough.
          </li>
          <li>Add your sausage and contents of the pan to the stock pot or dutch oven. Add the remaining potatoes to the pot and bring it 
            to a soft boil. Taste and if needed, add a bit of salt at this point so you are not cooking your potatoes in a bland, unseasoned
             broth. You shouldn't need much because there is quite a bit in the sausage. Reduce the heat to medium-low for about 15 minutes. 
          </li>
          <li>Add your kale to the pot. It will look like way too much but it's not. It will cook down. You will probably need to add 
            it in batches. Keep adding and stirring until all the kale is in. Keep the pot at a simmer until the potatoes can be 
            smashed easily against the side of the pot and the kale is done to your preference. For me that is about another 10-15 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>Taste and adjust for salt if needed. </li>
        </ol>

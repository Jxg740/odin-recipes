      <h2>Gumbo Gooder Than Grits</h2>
        <p>This is a simple but delicious gumbo to give you the basics. The technique to make the roux is a little intimidating at first
          but is very quick and easy. If you burn it, just start over. It's only flour and oil so relax. Just make sure to have all Ingredients
          prepped and available once you start. The mixture of celery, bell pepper and onion is call the Trinity in cajun and creole 
          cooking. It is similar to mirepoix (carrot, onion, celery) in French cuisine.

      <h3>Steps</h3>
        <hr>
        <ol>
          <li>Dice your onion, celery, bell pepper and jalapeno if you like a spicier gumbo. They don't need to be perfect but keep them pretty 
              close in size. You can put them all together in one bowl or keep them separate. Mince your garlic and keep it separate.
          </li>
          <li>Cut the sausage in to bite size pieces. Either round pieces or chunks will work.</li>
          <li>To make your roux, heat a large stock pot on medium-high. Add your oil. When the oil starts heating up, add the flour. 
            Whisk constantly until roux turns dark brown, close to a dark chocolate color. Do not walk away during this step as the roux
            can easily burn in a few seconds. If it burns, just start over. Everyone burns a roux at some point.
          </li>
          <li>When roux is done, add celery, carrot, onion (your Trinity), and bay leaves to the pot. Adding to the hot roux will start to cook the
              trinity very quickly so stir frequently for the first minute or so. When the mixture has calmed down a bit and the trinity
              starts to become a bit translucent, add the minced garlic. Cook for about one more minute.
          </li>
          <li>Add your beer to the pot. Cook for a few minutes until it reduces a bit and the alcohol smell has cooked off.</li>
          <li>Add in your chicken stock, sausage, smoked paprika, cayenne, and black pepper.  Cayenne is to taste 
            but this needs lots of black pepper. Basically use your pepper mill and have at it until your arm gets tired. You can add 
            some salt at this point but don't go overboard. You will want to adjust for it later after this cooks down.
          </li>
          <li>The chicken thighs can be seared off at any point. If you are good with multi-tasking, you can do it while the trinity 
            cooks but it's easier to do after adding your stock. To sear, heat a large pan to medium or medium-high. Add just enough oil
            to coat pan. Season both side of chicken thighs with salt and pepper. Sear on both sides. This can be done in batches if your 
            pan is not big enough to hold all the chicken without over crowding the pan. Add the chicken to the stock pot. There should be 
            some crispy bits in the bottom of the pan. Add a bit of the gumbo liquid to the pan and scrape those bit up. Pour that back in 
            the pot. 
          </li>
          <li>Bring pot to a soft boil and reduce heat to low. Cover pot and simmer for 4-6 hours, stirring occasionally. The longer 
            the better. There will be a fair bit of oil on top that can be skimmed if you want. I don't skim much or any because it 
            tastes amazing. At this point you will taste for salt. There's a fair bit of salt in the sausage so it may be fine but 
            add more if you think it needs more. 
          </li>
          <li>Serve in a bowl with a scoop of white rice or just by itself if you don't feel like making rice.</li>

        <h2>Lasagna Bolognese so good they'll think your Nonna made it.</h2>
            <p>I like to spend my Sundays with a big pot of something simmering away on the stove or slowly doing it's thing in the oven.
                This is one of my favorites because it does both. It works great for a big family meal or for those that want plenty of leftovers.
                It also works really well to freeze and save for later.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <hr>
              <h4>For Bolognese</h4>
                  <ol>
                      <li>
                          Roughly chop carrots, onion and celery. Use food processor or blender to finely dice carrots. They should be about the 
                          same texture as your ground meat. Remove to a large bowl and do the same with your celery and onion. If you don't want 
                          to mince garlic, just toss the whole cloves in the food processor with the onion.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          In a large dutch oven or stock pot, add just enough olive oil to cover the bottom and bring it up to medium heat.
                          Add diced carrots, celery, onion and garlic. Season lightly with salt and pepper(You will be adding more later).
                          Cook, stirring occasionally, until all moisture has cooked off. There should be some bits lightly caramelizing 
                          in the bottom of the pan. This is called fond and it's what dreams are made of. Because it tastes really good.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Add ground beef and pork to the pot. Cook until meat is done and a decent fond is forming in the bottom of the pan.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Add tomato paste and cook until it caramelizes, adding to the fond. It should be
                          very dark but not burnt. Have your wine open and ready to add because it will go from dark to burnt very quickly.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Add about half of a bottle of dry red wine and scrape all that delicious fond off the bottom of the pot with a
                          wooden spoon. Let the mixture cook until the wine has reduced by half. Add your chicken stock or water. You just 
                          need enough to cover the meat. You'll add more later.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Add in your bay leaves, thyme and rosemary. If you have trussing twine, tie the thyme and rosemary in a bundle and 
                          leave about 6-8 inches of twine on the end. Tie that end to the handle of your pot to make it easy to remove stems
                          when the sauce is done.(This is where you would toss in your parm rind if you have one)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Reduce to a simmer and loosely cover the pot, leaving a small gap. Simmer for at least 4 hours, longer is better.
                          Check on it and stir about once an hour. If the level of liquid is getting low, add enough to cover.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          When the 4+ hours are up(seriously, longer is better), add your cream and grated parm. Here's where you can start
                          building your lasagna if you want but this stuff gets better if you let it sit in the fridge overnight(or 2 nights.)
                      </li>
                  </ol>
              <h4>Assemble Lasagna</h4>
                  <ol>
                      <li>
                          In a large bowl, combine sour cream, cottage cheese, egg, grated parm, Italian seasoning and salt and pepper to
                          taste. This will henceforth be known as lasagna mix.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Lightly coat the bottom of the lasagna pan with bolognese. Add one layer of lasagna noodles, either cooked according to the 
                          box or buy noods that cook in the oven. Now you'll start building your layers. Start with your lasagna mixture,
                          followed by bolognese, sliced or shredded mozzerella, and another layer of noodles. Repeat until the dish is full 
                          or you run out of lasagna mix. The final layer should be noodles on the bottom, then bolognese, finally topped with
                          shredded Gruyere, mozzerella and parm. I like to finish it off with some more Italian seasoning.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Cover loosely with foil. Try to lift the center of the foil up to make kind of a tent over the lasagna to keep the cheese
                          from sticking to it. Place in an oven pre-heated to about 375 and bake for about 30-40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until
                          the cheese starts to get some color to it(about 15 more minutes). Make sure to let it sit for at least 20 minutes before cutting
                          after removing from the oven. It's basically soup when it comes out and it all needs to cool down and congeal a bit.

                          And that's it. Eat that shit. You earned it. That took a long time and your house smelled good as fuck the whole time.
